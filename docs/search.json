Welcome!\n\nMachine Learning Blog Posts\nBlog 1 - Probability theory and random variables\nProbability theory is the mathematical study of uncertainty, quantifying uncertainty about the world. It is important to understand as a basis to machine learning, because the design of learning algorithms often relies on probabilistic assumptions about the data. Probability theory allows algorithms to reason effectively in situations where there cannot be certainty.\nRandom Variables:\n                Random variables are at the core of probability theory, they are a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random process. They can be discrete, taking a specific value from a finite set, or continuous, having any value in a range. In Machine learning, random variables often represent the input features, output predictions, or latent variables in the model.\nDependent and Independent events\n                Events are called independent if the probability of one event does not influence the other, such as flipping a coin and getting heads twice in a row.\nMultiple views on Probability Theory\nBayesian Probability\n                The Bayesian view of probability contrasts frequentist probability in the sense that the latter relies on the existence of one best combination of parameters. The Bayesian probability treats parameters as random variables. Therefore, each parameter has its own probability distribution.\nFrequentist Probability\n                If you are counting how often particular events occur, such as the percentage a coin flip will land on heads versus tails, you are taking a frequentist view of the probabilities. The frequency to which a coin will land on heads or tails is a probability\nConditional Probability\n                When looking at the probability of one event due to another, this is conditional probability. One example is \"what is the probability of a car crash when there is rain?\"\nDependent and Independent events\n                One event is called independent if the probability of one event does not influence the other.\nApplications in Machine Learning\n-          Data Modeling: machine learning models often work by using data that has randomness/uncertainty. Random variables are used to quantify this uncertainty, allowing for the development of models.\n-          Bayesian inference: Bayesian methods are used in machine learning for decision-making involving uncertainty. These methods leverage probability theory and random variables to update predicitons when new data is available.\n-          Classification: in classification models, where we assign data to specific categories, random variables can be used to represent the uncertainty with each class assignment.\n-          Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment to learn optimal actions – random variables are used to represent rewards and consequences, helping the user to make decisions under uncertain circumstances."

    "text": "Hey there, thanks for stopping by my blog! I’m Riley Rudd, and I’m excited to have you here. This blog is all about sharing experiences, insights, and everything in-between. My interests are all over the place, so this is an opportunity for me to present myself in a more thorough way than a resume, while also sharing some detailed experiences/knowledge that may be helpful for others. If you’d like to see my resume, I’ve linked it at the top of my page - otherwise, let’s skip the formalities and get to know me a bit better.\nHow to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at riley.rudd1@gmail.com, or check out my linkedin profile.\nThe Journey So Far:\nLet’s jump into my academic background and a few life tidbits:\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science - Data Analytics & AI: Currently, I’m continuing my academic adventure at Virginia Tech, pursuing a graduate degree in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. It’s been really interesting experience, and I can’t wait to share some of the cool stuff I’ve been learning with you. My expected graduation date? December 2024.\nBachelor of Arts in Economics: I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Virginia Tech in May 2023. I originally didn’t expect to enjoy learning about economics, but I had a great professor during a Principles of Economics class that inspired my interests in economics.\nBachelor of Science in Consumer Studies - Financial Services & Counseling: Fortunately, I had the room in my schedule to fit in a double-major in Consumer Studies. This degree was much more applied knowledge, and led me to becoming President (and Founder) of the Consumer Studies Student Organization. Specializing in financial services and counseling adds a whole new dimension to my life and education.\nMy areas of study may seem a little random, but actually, having a broader background has helped me in every professional experience I’ve had. My master’s degree has helped me build immense technical skill in computer science while still having applied understanding of business and government through Consumer Studies, all wrapped up with the theoretical understanding of economics.\nBeyond Textbooks:\nBesides the academic journey, I’ve had a blast doing some other cool stuff:\nFounder and President of the Virginia Tech Consumer Studies Organization: I worked with faculty members to re-create a student organization inspired by the Consumer Studies major and led the charge from December 2021 to May 2023. We organized meetings, brought in guest speakers, and even had some fun study sessions. One of my favorite memories from this club was our trip to Richmond to visit the Virginia State Corporation Commission, the Attorney General’s Office, and even watched a General Assembly session.\nGetting My Research Hands Dirty: I’ve also dipped my toes into some meaningful research projects. One of them, “Sensing Drought in the Sahel for Household Resilience,” was published by the University of Virginia Biocomplexity Institute. It was a deep dive into real-world climate resilience. This experience was really transformational in my academic career, inspiring me to pursue a Masters degree in Computer Science. I would love future opportunities to use data science for public good.\nProfessional Adventures:\nMarketing Specialist at TriMech: I’m currently working for TriMech, marketing for our Staffing and Project Engineering teams, juggling various marketing tactics to generate leads and make an impact. I feel a lot of trust with my team at TriMech, and it’s allowed me to build confidence in a wide variety of skills. Our video marketing project won the 2022 SolidWorks Reseller “Best Digital Media Adopt” award. Plus, I’m super proud to be an “Impact Player” as part of the “President’s Club” in 2023.\nResearch Assistant: My work as a Research Assistant was all about working with data to help the U.S. Crop Insurance Program make better decisions. We were digging into drought indicators, focusing on how various approaches would impact payout functions. I worked with one of my favorite Virginia Tech faculty members, Elinor Benami, on this project. She is a great mentor and has inspired me to be a better leader.\nYoung Scholars Research Intern: I worked on the “Data Science for the Public Good” project, using data analysis skills to inform financial donor decisions. This program was really my introduction to data science, and I am so grateful to have been a part of it. I am still close with some of the other interns to this day!\nBeyond the Resume:\nAside from my work and studies, I’m an avid reader of many topics, but mostly enjoy reading as an escape of reality when needed. To balance out all that brainwork, I’ve also been playing rugby since 2019.\nSo, that’s me in a nutshell. If you’d like to see more of my specific insights, check out some of my blog posts. Don’t be shy – reach out with your questions or thoughts. I’d love to connect with you!"
